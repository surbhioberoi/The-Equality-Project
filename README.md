## The Equality Project

The Equality Project focuses on highlighting various inequalities around the world. The data from which the information is extracted comes from Wikepedia and United Nations open source data. The information displayed was collected manually over a few days of time. 

The maps are rendered using mapbox and leaflet.js. The data is in CSV file that is being used to generate a geoJSON file.

#### To contribute

1. Clone the project.

2. Open the parameters.csv file to add data (excel sheet).

3. Send a pull request with your edited parameters.csv file or mail your edited file to mail@surbhioberoi.com.

The project will be an ongoing work and more data will be added over time. Since it is open source, anyone may contribute data.
